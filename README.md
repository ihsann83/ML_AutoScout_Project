# ML_AutoScout_Project

In this Senario, I estimated the prices of cars using regression algorithms.

I imported the necessary modules and loaded the data given as pkl file. Also I did a few pre-processing before moving to modelling. After that I implemented Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression,and Elastic-Net algorithms respectively. I checked the success of the models with regression evaluation metrics as well as with cross validation method.

For the better results, I tried to increase the success of the models by performing hyperparameter tuning. I determined feature importances for the model. Then, I set the model with the most important features for resource saving. 

Finally I compared the performances of algorithms

# Determines
Auto Scout data which using for this project, scraped from the on-line car trading company(https://www.autoscout24.com)in 2019, contains many features of 9 different car models. In this project, you will use the data set which is already preprocessed and prepared for algorithms .

The aim of this project to understand of machine learning algorithms. Therefore, you will not need any EDA process as you will be working on the edited data.
